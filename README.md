# WebGL 2D Vertex Coordinates Tool

An interactive educational tool to help students understand WebGL vertex coordinates and primitive types.

## Features

- Interactive canvas where students can place vertices
- Real-time visualization of WebGL primitives
- Conversion between pixel coordinates and Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)
- Support for multiple primitive types (POINTS, LINES, TRIANGLES, etc.)
- Color selection for vertices
- Auto demo mode to show optimal vertex placement
- 3D shape examples
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## How to Use

1. Select a primitive type from the dropdown menu
2. Click on the left canvas to place vertices
3. Watch as the shape appears in the WebGL canvas on the right
4. Use the auto demo button to see predefined examples
5. Copy the generated code to use in your own WebGL projects
